We considered {\textasciitilde}400 emission control measures to reduce these pollutants by using current technology and experience. We identified 14 measures targeting methane and BC emissions that reduce projected global mean warming {\textasciitilde}0.5°C by 2050. This strategy avoids 0.7 to 4.7 million annual premature deaths from outdoor air pollution and increases annual crop yields by 30 to 135 million metric tons due to ozone reductions in 2030 and beyond. Benefits of methane emissions reductions are valued at \$700 to \$5000 per metric ton, which is well above typical marginal abatement costs (less than \$250). The selected controls target different sources and influence climate on shorter time scales than those of carbon dioxide–reduction measures. Implementing both substantially reduces the risks of crossing the 2°C threshold.
Reducing anthropogenic emissions of methane and black carbon would have multiple climate and health benefits.

	abstract = {The term “alkaliphile” is used for microorganisms that grow optimally or very well at pH values above 9 but cannot grow or grow only slowly at the near-neutral pH value of 6.5. Alkaliphiles include prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and archaea. Many different taxa are represented among the alkaliphiles, and some of these have been proposed as new taxa. Alkaliphiles can be isolated from normal environments such as garden soil, although viable counts of alkaliphiles are higher in samples from alkaline environments. The cell surface may play a key role in keeping the intracellular pH value in the range between 7 and 8.5, allowing alkaliphiles to thrive in alkaline environments, although adaptation mechanisms have not yet been clarified. Alkaliphiles have made a great impact in industrial applications. Biological detergents contain alkaline enzymes, such as alkaline cellulases and/or alkaline proteases, that have been produced from alkaliphiles. The current proportion of total world enzyme production destined for the laundry detergent market exceeds 60\%. Another important application is the industrial production of cyclodextrin by alkaline cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase. This enzyme has reduced the production cost and paved the way for cyclodextrin use in large quantities in foodstuffs, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. It has also been reported that alkali-treated wood pulp could be biologically bleached by xylanases produced by alkaliphiles. Other applications of various aspects of alkaliphiles are also discussed.},

The continual and elevated production of H2 is capable of reducing carbon, thus initiating an inorganic pathway to produce organic compounds. The production of H2 and H2-dependent CH4 in serpentinization systems has received significant interdisciplinary interest, especially with regard to the abiotic synthesis of organic compounds and the origins and maintenance of life in Earth's lithosphere and elsewhere in the Universe. Here, serpentinization with an emphasis on the formation of H2 and CH4 are reviewed within the context of the mineralogy, temperature/pressure, and fluid/gas chemistry present in planetary environments. Whether deep in Earth's interior or in Kuiper Belt Objects in space, serpentinization is a feasible process to invoke as a means of producing astrobiologically indispensable H2 capable of reducing carbon to organic compounds.

	abstract = {The present study demonstrates that γ-radiolyzed perchlorate-containing Mars soil salt analogues (in a CO2 atmosphere) generate upon H2O wetting the reactive oxygen species (ROS) superoxide radical (O2•−), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radicals (•OH). This study also validates that analogue radiolysis forms oxychlorine species that, in turn, can UV-photolyze to •OH upon UV photolysis. This investigation was made possible by the development of a new assay for inorganic-origin O2•− and H2O2 determination and by the modification of a previous assay for soil •OH. Results show that radiolyzed Mg(ClO4)2 generates H2O2 and •OH; and when included as part of a mixture analogous to the salt composition of samples analyzed at the Mars Phoenix site, the analogue generated O2•−, H2O2, and •OH, with •OH levels 150-fold higher than in the radiolyzed Mg(ClO4)2 samples. Radiolyzed Mars Phoenix site salt analogue that did not contain Mg(ClO4)2 generated only •OH also at 150-fold higher concentration than Mg(ClO4)2 alone. Additionally, UV photolysis of the perchlorate γ radiolysis product chlorite (ClO2−) generated the oxychlorine products trihalide (Cl3−), chlorine dioxide (ClO2•), and hypochlorite (ClO−), with the formation of •OH by UV photolysis of ClO−. While the generation of ROS may have contributed in part to 14CO2 production in the Viking Labeled Release (LR) experiment and O2 (g) release in the Viking Gas Exchange (GEx) experiment, our results indicate that they are not likely to be the major contributor to the LR and GEx results. However, due to their highly reactive nature, they are expected to play a significant role in the alteration of organics on Mars. Additionally, experiments with hypochlorite show that the thermal stability of NaClO is in the range of the thermal stability observed for thermally liable oxidant responsible for the Viking LR results.

	abstract = {Atmospheric measurements at several surface stations made between 1978 and 1990 of the anthropogenic chemical compound 1,1,1-trichloroethane (methyl chloroform, CH3CCl3) show it increasing at a global average rate of 4.4 ± 0.2\% per year (1σ) over this time period. The measured trends combined with industrial emission estimates are used in an optimal estimation inversion scheme to deduce a globally averaged CH3CCl3 tropospheric (and total atmospheric) lifetime of 5.7 (+0.7, −0.6) years (1σ) and a weighted global average tropospheric hydroxyl radical (OH) concentration of (8.7 ± 1.0) × 105 radical cm−3 (1σ). Inclusion of a small loss rate to the ocean for CH3CCl3 of 1/85 year−1 does not affect the stated lifetime but lowers the stated OH concentration to (8.1 ± 0.9) × 105 radical cm−3 (1σ). The rate of change of the weighted global average OH concentration over this time period is determined to be 1.0 ± 0.8\% per year (1σ) which has major implications for the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere and more specifically for methane (CH4), which like CH3CCl3 is destroyed primarily by OH radicals. Because the weighting strongly favors the tropical lower troposphere, this deduced positive OH trend is qualitatively consistent with hypothesized changes in tropical tropospheric OH and ozone concentrations driven by tropical urbanization, biomass burning, land use changes, and long-term warming. We caution, however, that our deduced rate of change in OH assumes that current industry estimates of anthropogenic emissions and our absolute calibration of CH3CCl3 are accurate. The CH3CCl3 measurements at our tropical South Pacific station (Samoa) show remarkable sensitivity to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which we attribute to modulation of cross-equatorial transport during the northern hemisphere winter by the interannually varying upper tropospheric zonal winds in the equatorial Pacific. Thus measurements of this chemical compound have led to the discovery of a previously unappreciated aspect of tropical atmospheric tracer transport.},

	abstract = {The detection of methane on Mars1,2,3 has revived the possibility of past or extant life on this planet, despite the fact that an abiogenic origin is thought to be equally plausible4. An intriguing aspect of the recent observations of methane on Mars is that methane concentrations appear to be locally enhanced and change with the seasons3. However, methane has a photochemical lifetime of several centuries, and is therefore expected to have a spatially uniform distribution on the planet5. Here we use a global climate model of Mars with coupled chemistry6,7,8 to examine the implications of the recently observed variations of Martian methane for our understanding of the chemistry of methane. We find that photochemistry as currently understood does not produce measurable variations in methane concentrations, even in the case of a current, local and episodic methane release. In contrast, we find that the condensation–sublimation cycle of Mars’ carbon dioxide atmosphere can generate large-scale methane variations differing from those observed. In order to reproduce local methane enhancements similar to those recently reported3, we show that an atmospheric lifetime of less than 200 days is necessary, even if a local source of methane is only active around the time of the observation itself. This implies an unidentified methane loss process that is 600 times faster than predicted by standard photochemistry. The existence of such a fast loss in the Martian atmosphere is difficult to reconcile with the observed distribution of other trace gas species. In the case of a destruction mechanism only active at the surface of Mars, destruction of methane must occur with an even shorter timescale of the order of ∼1 hour to explain the observations. If recent observations of spatial and temporal variations of methane are confirmed, this would suggest an extraordinarily harsh environment for the survival of organics on the planet.},

	abstract = {Abstract Methane (CH4) is produced in many natural systems that are vulnerable to change under a warming climate, yet current CH4 budgets, as well as future shifts in CH4 emissions, have high uncertainties. Climate change has the potential to increase CH4 emissions from critical systems such as wetlands, marine and freshwater systems, permafrost, and methane hydrates, through shifts in temperature, hydrology, vegetation, landscape disturbance, and sea level rise. Increased CH4 emissions from these systems would in turn induce further climate change, resulting in a positive climate feedback. Here we synthesize biological, geochemical, and physically focused CH4 climate feedback literature, bringing together the key findings of these disciplines. We discuss environment?specific feedback processes, including the microbial, physical, and geochemical interlinkages and the timescales on which they operate, and present the current state of knowledge of CH4 climate feedbacks in the immediate and distant future. The important linkages between microbial activity and climate warming are discussed with the aim to better constrain the sensitivity of the CH4 cycle to future climate predictions. We determine that wetlands will form the majority of the CH4 climate feedback up to 2100. Beyond this timescale, CH4 emissions from marine and freshwater systems and permafrost environments could become more important. Significant CH4 emissions to the atmosphere from the dissociation of methane hydrates are not expected in the near future. Our key findings highlight the importance of quantifying whether CH4 consumption can counterbalance CH4 production under future climate scenarios.},

	abstract = {Long-term Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) datasets collected at the three tropical western Pacific (TWP) sites are used to evaluate the ability of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5) to simulate the various types of clouds, their seasonal and diurnal variations, and their impact on surface radiation. A number of CAM5 simulations are conducted at various horizontal grid spacing (around 2°, 1°, 0.5°, and 0.25°) with meteorological constraints from analysis or reanalysis. Model biases in the seasonal cycle of cloudiness are found to be weakly dependent on model resolution. Positive biases (up to 20\%) in the annual mean total cloud fraction appear mostly in stratiform ice clouds. Higher-resolution simulations do reduce the positive bias in ice clouds, but they inadvertently increase the negative biases in convective clouds and low-level liquid clouds, leading to a positive bias in annual mean shortwave fluxes at the sites, as high as 65 W m−2 in the 0.25° simulation. Such resolution-dependent biases in clouds can adversely lead to biases in ambient thermodynamic properties and, in turn, produce feedback onto clouds. Both the model and observations show distinct diurnal cycles in total, stratiform, and convective cloud fractions; however, they are out of phase by 12 h and the biases vary by site. The results suggest that biases in deep convection affect the vertical distribution and diurnal cycle of stratiform clouds through the transport of vapor and/or the detrainment of liquid and ice. The approach used here can be easily adapted for the evaluation of new parameterizations being developed for CAM5 or other global or regional models.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have examined tropical upper tropospheric warming by comparing coupled atmosphere–ocean global circulation model (GCM) simulations from Phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) with satellite and radiosonde observations of warming in the tropical upper troposphere relative to the lower-middle troposphere. These studies showed that models tended to overestimate increases in static stability between the upper and lower-middle troposphere. We revisit this issue using atmospheric GCMs with prescribed historical sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and coupled atmosphere–ocean GCMs that participated in the latest model intercomparison project, CMIP5. It is demonstrated that even with historical SSTs as a boundary condition, most atmospheric models exhibit excessive tropical upper tropospheric warming relative to the lower-middle troposphere as compared with satellite-borne microwave sounding unit measurements. It is also shown that the results from CMIP5 coupled atmosphere–ocean GCMs are similar to findings from CMIP3 coupled GCMs. The apparent model-observational difference for tropical upper tropospheric warming represents an important problem, but it is not clear whether the difference is a result of common biases in GCMs, biases in observational datasets, or both.},

The results give insight into how emissions of one trace species cause perturbations to another and how transport and chemistry can alter the time scale of the overall perturbation. Further, the eigenvectors describe the fundamental chemical modes, or patterns, of the atmosphere's chemical response to perturbations.},

	abstract = {Abstract The atmospheric methane (CH4) chemical feedback is a key process for understanding the behavior of atmospheric CH4 and its environmental impact. This work reviews how the feedback is defined and used, then examines the meteorological, chemical, and emission factors that control the feedback strength. Geographical and temporal variations in the feedback are described and explained by HOx (HOx?=?OH?+?HO2) production and partitioning. Different CH4 boundary conditions used by models, however, make no meaningful difference to the feedback calculation. The strength of the CH4 feedback depends on atmospheric composition, particularly the atmospheric CH4 burden, and is therefore not constant. Sensitivity tests show that the feedback depends very weakly on temperature, insolation, water vapor, and emissions of NO. While the feedback strength has likely remained within 10\% of its present value over the industrial era and likely will over the twenty?first century, neglecting these changes biases our understanding of CH4 impacts. Most environmental consequences per kg of CH4 emissions, including its global warming potential (GWP), scale with the perturbation time, which may have grown as much as 40\% over the industrial era and continues to rise.},

By considering gravity wave phase speeds, we find that the circulation adjustment into weak temperature gradient (WTG) balance occurs rapidly ({\textless}6 h) relative to diurnal diabatic forcing on the spatial scales typical of organized convection (≤500 km). Convection-permitting numerical simulations of self-aggregation in diurnal radiative–convective equilibrium (RCE) are conducted to explore this further. These simulations depict a pronounced diurnal cycle of circulation linked to organized convection, which indeed maintains WTG balance to first order. A set of sensitivity experiments is conducted to assess what governs the diurnal cycle of organized convection. We find that the “direct radiation–convection interaction” (or lapse-rate) mechanism is of primary importance for diurnal precipitation range, while the “dynamic cloudy–clear differential radiation” mechanism amplifies the range by ∼30\%, and delays the nocturnal precipitation peak by ∼5 h. The differential radiation mechanism therefore explains the tendency for tropical heavy rainfall to peak in the early morning, while the lapse-rate mechanism primarily governs diurnal amplitude. The diurnal evolution of circulation can be understood as follows. While nocturnal deep convection invigorated by cloud-top cooling (i.e., the lapse-rate mechanism) leads to strong bottom-heavy circulation at nighttime, the localized (i.e., differential) top-heavy shortwave warming in the convective region maintains circulation at upper levels in daytime. A diurnal evolution of the circulation therefore arises, from bottom-heavy at nighttime to top-heavy in daytime, in a qualitatively consistent manner with the observed diurnal pulsing of the Hadley cell driven by the ITCZ.},

	abstract = {An uncertain representation of convective clouds has emerged as one of the key barriers to our understanding of climate sensitivity. The large gap in resolved spatial scales between General Circulation Models (GCMs) and high resolution models has made a systematic study of convective clouds across model configurations difficult. It is shown here that the simulated atmosphere of a GCM in Radiative Convective Equilibrium (RCE) is sufficiently similar across a range of domain sizes to justify the use of RCE to study both a GCM and a high resolution model on the same domain with the goal of improved constraints on the parameterized clouds. Simulations of RCE with parameterized convection have been analyzed on domains with areas spanning more than two orders of magnitude ( ), all having the same grid spacing of . The simulated climates on different domains are qualitatively similar in their degree of convective organization, the precipitation rates, and the vertical structure of the clouds and water vapor, with the similarity increasing as the domain size increases. Sea surface temperature perturbation experiments are used to estimate the climate feedback parameter for the differently configured experiments, and the cloud radiative effect is computed to examine the role which clouds play in the response. Despite the similar climate states between the domains the feedback parameter varies by more than a factor of two; the hydrological sensitivity parameter is better behaved, varying by a factor of 1.4. The sensitivity of the climate feedback parameter to domain size is related foremost to a nonsystematic response of low-level clouds as well as an increasingly negative longwave feedback on larger domains.},

The development of such models over the past decades is reviewed and their specific features are presented. The latter include a non-hydrostatic dynamic and parameterizations of sub-grid turbulence, microphysical and radiative processes. The capabilities of such models are discussed based on comparisons with observations and model-intercomparison studies. CRMs are used in a variety of ways, from the exploration of cloud phenomenology and process-understanding studies to the development of algorithms for satellite products, as well as to address climate issues and to develop convective and cloud parametrizations for large-scale weather and climate models. A few results illustrating this wide utilization are presented. The continuous increase of computer power induces rapid changes in modelling perspectives and therefore, influences the developments and applications of CRMs. This is discussed together with emerging scientific questions which will further benefit from CRM simulations.},

We perform simulations of three-dimensional radiative-convective equilibrium with the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM) cloud-system-resolving model, with interactive surface temperature, where a highly idealized, low heat capacity circular island is embedded in a slab-ocean domain. The calculated precipitation rate over the island can be more than double the domain average value, with island rainfall occurring primarily in an intense, regular thunderstorm system that forms in the afternoon to early evening each day. Island size affects the magnitude of simulated island rainfall enhancement, the intensity of the convection, and the timing of the rainfall maximum relative to solar noon. A combination of dynamic and thermodynamic mechanisms leads to a monotonic enhancement of domain-averaged tropospheric temperature with increasing fraction of island surface, which may contribute to localization of ascent over the Maritime Continent and its relationship to the Walker Circulation.},

	abstract = {In models of radiative–convective equilibrium it is known that convection can spontaneously aggregate into one single localized moist region if the domain is large enough. The large changes in the mean climate state and radiative fluxes accompanying this self-aggregation raise questions as to what simulations at lower resolutions with parameterized convection, in similar homogeneous geometries, should be expected to produce to be considered successful in mimicking a cloud-resolving model.The authors investigate this self-aggregation in a nonrotating, three-dimensional cloud-resolving model on a square domain without large-scale forcing. It is found that self-aggregation is sensitive not only to the domain size, but also to the horizontal resolution. With horizontally homogeneous initial conditions, convective aggregation only occurs on domains larger than about 200km and with resolutions coarser than about 2km in the model examined. The system exhibits hysteresis, so that with aggregated initial conditions, convection remains aggregated even at our finest resolution, 500m, as long as the domain is greater than 200–300km.The sensitivity of self-aggregation to resolution and domain size in this model is due to the sensitivity of the distribution of low clouds to these two parameters. Indeed, the mechanism responsible for the aggregation of convection is the dynamical response to the longwave radiative cooling from low clouds. Strong longwave cooling near cloud top in dry regions forces downward motion, which by continuity generates inflow near cloud top and near-surface outflow from dry regions. This circulation results in the net export of moist static energy from regions with low moist static energy, yielding a positive feedback.},

	abstract = {Methane lies at the nexus of climate and air quality, being both a major anthropogenic greenhouse gas—causing about one-half of the warming of carbon dioxide—and a precursor of tropospheric ozone pollution. Over the industrial era, atmospheric methane abundances rose from about 720 parts per billion (ppb) (10−9 mole fraction) to over 1,850 ppb today. Humans have driven this change largely through agriculture, waste, and fossil fuel emissions. The community’s regular review of the science of atmospheric methane via the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports [First Assessment Report (FAR), 1990 (1); Second Assessment Report (SAR), 1995 (2); Third Assessment Report (TAR), 2001 (3); Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), 2007 (4); and Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), 2013 (5)] has maintained both a scientific interest and political urgency as nations seek to mitigate near-term climate change and keep the overall warming to less than 2 °C (6⇓⇓–9). The recent history (Fig. 1), based on ref. 10, shows a complex overall growth with different rates and even a pause from 2000 to 2006. The many conflicting reports of this recent variability (11⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–23) suggest that it remains unexplained, or perhaps overexplained. Past work has separately used measurements of methane, its isotopes, and related gases to interpret the methane history. Two new publications (24, 25) combine these complementary data into a consistent Bayesian modeling framework and use advanced statistical methods to match all observations simultaneously subject to the prior constraints. Notably, they advance our understanding of what could have caused the variability. The similarities and differences of optimal solutions that emerge from both studies teach us about the information contained in present observations, as well as their limits.

	abstract = {Atmospheric CH4 perturbations, caused directly by CH4 emissions or indirectly by those of CO are enhanced by chemical feedbacks. They can be diagnosed in terms of the natural modes of atmospheric chemistry that are general solutions of the continuity equations. Each mode is a pattern in the global distribution of all chemical species, and each has a single time-constant that accurately describes its exponential decay about a given atmospheric state. This mathematical theory extends earlier work and is general for 2-D and 3-D chemistry-transport models. A formal proof relates the steady-state distribution and its lifetime to the integral of the true time-dependent response (properly included in the recent IPCC assessment). Changes in CO are also known to perturb CH4; however, the impact of CO emissions on climate has not been formally assessed in part because the short lifetime of CO (months) relative to that of CH4 (decade) was believed to limit the integrated impact. Using the IPCC model studies, this theory predicts that adding 5 CO molecules to today's atmosphere is equivalent to adding 1 CH4 molecule with the same decadal duration as direct CH4 addition. Extrapolating these results, CH4 sources would have to triple before runaway growth, wherein CH4 emissions exceed the oxidizing capacity of the troposphere.},

	abstract = {The growth in global methane (CH4) concentration, which had been ongoing since the industrial revolution, stalled around the year 2000 before resuming globally in 2007. We evaluate the role of the hydroxyl radical (OH), the major CH4 sink, in the recent CH4 growth. We also examine the influence of systematic uncertainties in OH concentrations on CH4 emissions inferred from atmospheric observations. We use observations of 1,1,1-trichloroethane (CH3CCl3), which is lost primarily through reaction with OH, to estimate OH levels as well as CH3CC3 emissions, which have uncertainty that previously limited the accuracy of OH estimates. We find a 64–70\% probability that a decline in OH has contributed to the post-2007 methane rise. Our median solution suggests that CH4 emissions increased relatively steadily during the late 1990s and early 2000s, after which growth was more modest. This solution obviates the need for a sudden statistically significant change in total CH4 emissions around the year 2007 to explain the atmospheric observations and can explain some of the decline in the atmospheric 13CH4/12CH4 ratio and the recent growth in C2H6. Our approach indicates that significant OH-related uncertainties in the CH4 budget remain, and we find that it is not possible to implicate, with a high degree of confidence, rapid global CH4 emissions changes as the primary driver of recent trends when our inferred OH trends and these uncertainties are considered.},

	abstract = {From 2007 to 2013, the globally averaged mole fraction of methane in the atmosphere increased by 5.7 ± 1.2 ppb yr−1. Simultaneously, δ13CCH4 (a measure of the 13C/12C isotope ratio in methane) has shifted to significantly more negative values since 2007. Growth was extreme in 2014, at 12.5 ± 0.4 ppb, with a further shift to more negative values being observed at most latitudes. The isotopic evidence presented here suggests that the methane rise was dominated by significant increases in biogenic methane emissions, particularly in the tropics, for example, from expansion of tropical wetlands in years with strongly positive rainfall anomalies or emissions from increased agricultural sources such as ruminants and rice paddies. Changes in the removal rate of methane by the OH radical have not been seen in other tracers of atmospheric chemistry and do not appear to explain short-term variations in methane. Fossil fuel emissions may also have grown, but the sustained shift to more 13C-depleted values and its significant interannual variability, and the tropical and Southern Hemisphere loci of post-2007 growth, both indicate that fossil fuel emissions have not been the dominant factor driving the increase. A major cause of increased tropical wetland and tropical agricultural methane emissions, the likely major contributors to growth, may be their responses to meteorological change.},

	abstract = {The hydroxyl radical (OH) is the main tropospheric oxidant and is the largest sink for atmospheric methane. The global abundance of OH has been monitored for the past decades with the methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3) proxy. This approach is becoming ineffective as atmospheric CH3CCl3 concentrations decline. Here we propose that satellite observations of atmospheric methane in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) can provide an effective replacement method. The premise is that the atmospheric signature of the methane sink from oxidation by OH is distinct from that of methane emissions. We evaluate this method in an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) framework using synthetic SWIR and TIR satellite observations representative of the TROPOMI and CrIS instruments, respectively. The synthetic observations are interpreted with a Bayesian inverse analysis optimizing both gridded methane emissions and global OH concentrations with detailed error accounting, including errors in meteorological fields and in OH distributions. We find that the satellite observations can constrain the global tropospheric OH concentrations with a precision better than 1 \% and an accuracy of about 3 \% for SWIR and 7 \% for TIR. The inversion can successfully separate contributions from methane emissions and OH concentrations to the methane budget and its trend. We also show that satellite methane observations can constrain the interhemispheric difference in OH. The main limitation to the accuracy is uncertainty in the spatial and seasonal distribution of OH.},

As prognostic variables, it uses total water and entropy, which are conserved in adiabatic and reversible processes, including reversible phase changes of water. This has numerical advantages for modeling clouds, in which reversible phase changes of water occur frequently. The equations of motion are discretized using higher-order weighted essentially nonoscillatory ({WENO}) discretization schemes with strong stability preserving time stepping. Numerical tests demonstrate that the {WENO} schemes yield simulations superior to centered schemes, even when the {WENO} schemes are used at coarser resolution. The framework is implemented in a new {LES} code written in Python and Cython, which makes the code transparent and easy to use for a wide user group.},

Despite decades of research attempting to narrow uncertainties, equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates from climate models still span roughly 1.5 to 5 degrees Celsius for a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, precluding accurate projections of future climate. The spread arises largely from differences in the feedback from low clouds, for reasons not yet understood. Here we show that differences in the simulated strength of convective mixing between the lower and middle tropical troposphere explain about half of the variance in climate sensitivity estimated by 43 climate models. The apparent mechanism is that such mixing dehydrates the low-cloud layer at a rate that increases as the climate warms, and this rate of increase depends on the initial mixing strength, linking the mixing to cloud feedback. The mixing inferred from observations appears to be sufficiently strong to imply a climate sensitivity of more than 3 degrees for a doubling of carbon dioxide. This is significantly higher than the currently accepted lower bound of 1.5 degrees, thereby constraining model projections towards relatively severe future warming.},

The study uses a set of atmospheric states that were created specifically for the {SGP} and for the purpose of investigating under what synoptic conditions models compare well with observations on a statistical basis (rather than using case studies or seasonal or longer time scale averaging). Differences in the annual mean diurnal cycle between observations and the {MMF} are decomposed into differences due to the relative frequency of states, the daily mean vertical profile of hydrometeor occurrence, and the (normalized) diurnal variation of hydrometeors in each state. Here the hydrometeors are classified as cloud or precipitation based solely on the reflectivity observed by a millimeter radar or generated by a radar simulator. The results show that the {MMF} does not capture the diurnal variation of low clouds well in any of the states but does a reasonable job capturing the diurnal variations of high clouds and precipitation in some states. In particular, the diurnal variations in states that occur during summer are reasonably captured by the {MMF}, while the diurnal variations in states that occur during the transition seasons (spring and fall) are not well captured. Overall, the errors in the annual composite are due primarily to errors in the daily mean of hydrometeor occurrence (rather than diurnal variations), but errors in the state frequency (that is, the distribution of weather states in the model) also play a significant role.},

    abstract = { Abstract The behavior and various controls of diurnal variability in tropical–subtropical rainfall are investigated using Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation measurements retrieved from the three level-2 TRMM standard profile algorithms for the 1998 annual cycle. Results show that diurnal variability characteristics of precipitation are consistent for all three algorithms, providing assurance that TRMM retrievals are producing consistent estimates of rainfall variability. As anticipated, most ocean areas exhibit more rainfall at night, while over most land areas, rainfall peaks during daytime; however, important exceptions are noted. The dominant feature of the oceanic diurnal cycle is a rainfall maximum in late-evening–early-morning (LE–EM) hours, while over land the dominant maximum occurs in the mid- to late afternoon (MLA). In conjunction with these maxima are pronounced seasonal variations of the diurnal amplitudes. Amplitude analysis shows that the diurnal pattern and its seasonal evolution are closely related to the rainfall accumulation pattern and its seasonal evolution. In addition, the horizontal distribution of diurnal variability indicates that for oceanic rainfall, there is a secondary MLA maximum coexisting with the LE–EM maximum at latitudes dominated by large-scale convergence and deep convection. Analogously, there is a preponderancy for an LE–EM maximum over land coexisting with the stronger MLA maximum, although it is not evident that this secondary continental feature is closely associated with the large-scale circulation. Neither of the secondary maxima exhibit phase behavior that can be considered semidiurnal in nature. Diurnal rainfall variability over the ocean associated with large-scale convection is clearly an integral component of the general circulation. Phase analysis reveals differences in regional and seasonal features of the diurnal cycle, indicating that underlying forcing mechanisms differ from place to place. This is underscored by the appearance of secondary ocean maxima in the presence of large-scale convection, along with other important features. Among these, there are clear-cut differences between the diurnal variability of seasonal rainfall over the mid-Pacific and Indian Ocean Basins. The mid-Pacific exhibits double maxima in spring and winter but only LE–EM maxima in summer and autumn, while the Indian Ocean exhibits double maxima in spring and summer and only an LE–EM maximum in autumn and winter. There are also evident daytime maxima within the major large-scale marine stratocumulus regions off the west coasts of continents. The study concludes with a discussion concerning how the observational evidence either supports or repudiates possible forcing mechanisms that have been suggested to explain diurnal rainfall variability. }

Here, we evaluate four different satellite data sets of hourly or 3-hourly precipitation (namely CMORPH, PERSIANN, TRMM 3B42 and a microwave-only product referred to as MI) by comparing the spatial patterns in seasonal mean precipitation amount, daily precipitation frequency and intensity, and the diurnal and semidiurnal cycles among them and with surface synoptic weather reports. We found that these high-resolution products show spatial patterns in seasonal mean precipitation amount comparable to other monthly products for the low- and mid-latitudes, and the mean daily precipitation frequency and intensity maps are similar among these pure satellite-based precipitation data sets and consistent with the frequency derived using weather reports over land. The satellite data show that spatial variations in mean precipitation amount come largely from precipitation frequency rather than intensity, and that the use of satellite infrared (IR) observations to improve sampling does not change the mean frequency, intensity and the diurnal cycle significantly. Consistent with previous studies, the satellite data show that sub-daily variations in precipitation are dominated by the 24-h cycle, which has an afternoon--evening maximum and mean-to-peak amplitude of 30--100{\%} of the daily mean in precipitation amount over most land areas during summer. Over most oceans, the 24-h harmonic has a peak from midnight to early morning with an amplitude of 10--30{\%} during both winter and summer. These diurnal results are broadly consistent with those based on the weather reports, although the time of maximum in the satellite precipitation is a few hours later (especially for TRMM and PERSIANN) than that in the surface observations over most land and ocean, and it is closer to the phase of showery precipitation from the weather reports. The TRMM and PERSIANN precipitation shows a spatially coherent time of maximum around 0300--0600 local solar time (LST) for a weak (amplitude <20{\%}) semi-diurnal (12-h) cycle over most mid- to high-latitudes, comparable to 0400--0600 LST in the surface data. The satellite data also confirm the notion that the diurnal cycle of precipitation amount comes mostly from its frequency rather than its intensity over most low and mid-latitudes, with the intensity has only about half of the strength of the diurnal cycle in the frequency and amount. The results suggest that these relatively new precipitation products can be useful for many applications.",

	abstract = {To evaluate the performance of version 2 of the Community Climate System Model ({CCSM}2) in simulating the diurnal cycle and to diagnose the deficiencies in underlying model physics, 10 years of 3-hourly data from a {CCSM}2 control run are analyzed for global and large-scale features of diurnal variations in surface air temperature, surface pressure, upper-air winds, cloud amount, and precipitation. The model-simulated diurnal variations are compared with available observations, most of which were derived from 3-hourly synoptic reports and some new results are reported for surface air temperatures. The {CCSM}2 reproduces most of the large-scale tidal variations in surface pressure and upper-air winds, although it overestimates the diurnal pressure tide by 20\%–50\% over low-latitude land and underestimates it over most oceans, the Rockies, and other midlatitude land areas. The {CCSM}2 captures the diurnal amplitude (1°–6°C) and phase [peak at 1400–1600 local solar time ({LST})] of surface air temperature over land, but over ocean the amplitude is too small (≤0.2°C). The {CCSM}2 overestimates the mean total cloud amount by 10\%–20\% of the sky from ∼15°S to 15°N during both December– January–February ({DJF}) and June–July–August ({JJA}) and over northern mid- and high-latitude land areas in {DJF}, whereas it underestimates the cloud amount by 10\%–30\% in the subtropics and parts of the midlatitudes. Over the marine stratocumulus regions west to the continents, the diagnostic cloud scheme in the {CCSM}2 underestimates the mean stratocumulus amount by 10\%–30\% and does not simulate the observed large diurnal variations (∼3\%–10\%) in the marine stratocumulus clouds even when driven by observational data. In the {CCSM}2, warm-season daytime moist convection over land starts prematurely around 0800 {LST}, about 4 hours too early compared with observations, and plateaus from 1100 to 1800 {LST}, in contrast to a sharp peak around 1600–1700 {LST} in observations. The premature initiation of convection prevents convective available potential energy ({CAPE}) from accumulating in the morning and early afternoon and intense convection from occurring in the mid to late afternoon. As a result of the extended duration of daytime convection over land, the {CCSM}2 rains too frequently at reduced intensity despite the fairly realistic patterns of rainy days with precipitation {\textgreater}1 mm day−1. Furthermore, the convective versus nonconvective precipitation ratio is too high in the model as deep convection removes atmospheric moisture prematurely. The simulated diurnal cycle of precipitation is too weak over the oceans, especially for convective precipitation. These results suggest that substantial improvements are desirable in the {CCSM}2 in simulating cloud amount, initiation of warm-season deep convection over land, and in the diurnal cycle in sea surface temperatures.},
